The banner for the WordPress Plugin Repository is based on the image "Coast and Geodetic Survey Ship FATHOMER. In service 1905-1941." published in **Public Domain** by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Department of Commerce, USA. Photograph by C&GS Season's Report Miller, 1911.

Text in the background is from the novel *Moby Dick* by Herman Melville.

And just in case you wonder about the maritime elements – this plugin is about *anchors*. :)
